# Technical Roadmap for an AI Trading Bot Platform (Agent-Based Implementation)

This roadmap outlines how an AI-driven crypto trading bot can be built using an agent-based architecture, where each component is handled by specialized agents coordinated through a main orchestrator. The goal is to create a modular, maintainable system that can be run with a simple command like `python main.py`. Each agent will handle specific tasks independently while communicating through a message broker system.

## 1. Agent-Based Architecture Overview
- **Main Orchestrator (`main.py`)**: Central coordinator that initializes and manages all agents
- **Configuration Management**: Uses a config file (`config.ini` or `config.json`) for global settings and agent-specific configurations
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Implements a message broker system (e.g., Redis pub/sub or RabbitMQ) for agent communication
- **Agent Base Class**: Common foundation for all agents with standard interfaces and communication methods

## 2. Core Agents Structure

### A. ConfigAgent
- Manages configuration and setup
- Loads and validates configuration files
- Handles API key management and security settings
- Provides configuration access to other agents

### B. DataAgent
- Manages market data collection and processing
- Connects to Binance WebSocket streams
- Maintains price history and market data
- Provides real-time and historical data to other agents

### C. AnalysisAgent
- Performs technical analysis on market data
- Computes indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Generates trading signals
- Manages custom strategy integration

### D. TradeAgent
- Executes trading operations
- Manages order placement and tracking
- Handles position management
- Implements risk management rules

### E. PortfolioAgent
- Manages account balance and positions
- Tracks profit/loss
- Handles tier-based profit logic
- Manages portfolio rebalancing

### F. MonitorAgent
- Monitors system health and performance
- Handles logging and alerting
- Tracks agent status and performance
- Manages error handling and recovery

## 3. Agent Implementation Details

        self.websocket_manager = None
        self.price_cache = {}
        
    async def start_data_streams(self):
        # Initialize WebSocket connections
        # Start data collection
        
    async def process_market_data(self):
        # Process incoming market data
        # Update price cache
        # Notify subscribers
```

### C. AnalysisAgent Implementation
```python
class AnalysisAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.indicators = {}
        self.strategies = {}
        
    async def compute_indicators(self):
        # Calculate technical indicators
        # Generate trading signals
        
    async def evaluate_strategies(self):
        # Run active trading strategies
        # Aggregate signals
        # Generate trade recommendations
```

### D. TradeAgent Implementation
```python
class TradeAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_orders = {}
        self.position_manager = None
        
    async def execute_trade(self):
        # Place orders based on signals
        # Manage stop-loss and take-profit
        
    async def monitor_positions(self):
        # Track open positions
        # Apply risk management rules
```

### E. PortfolioAgent Implementation
```python
class PortfolioAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = {}
        self.positions = {}
        
    async def update_portfolio(self):
        # Track account changes
        # Calculate profits/losses
        
    async def manage_tiers(self):
        # Apply tier-based rules
        # Calculate profit sharing
```

### F. MonitorAgent Implementation
```python
class MonitorAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.logs = []
        self.alerts = []
        
    async def monitor_system(self):
        # Track system health
        # Generate alerts
        
    async def log_activity(self):
        # Record system activity
        # Generate reports
```

## 4. Main Orchestrator Implementation
```python
class TradingBotOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}
        self.message_broker = None
